🔐 CyberSecurity-Projects

A curated collection of beginner to intermediate cybersecurity projects implemented in Python, focusing on fundamental security concepts such as cryptography, file integrity, and secure system design.

This repository is organized as a monorepo, where each folder represents an independent cybersecurity mini-project with its own documentation and codebase.
