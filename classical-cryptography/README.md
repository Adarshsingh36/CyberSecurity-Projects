\# Classical Cryptography Toolkit



This project contains implementations of classical cryptographic algorithms

used for educational and learning purposes. These ciphers help in

understanding the fundamentals of encryption and decryption techniques

used before modern cryptography.

\## 🔐 Ciphers Implemented



\### 1. Caesar Cipher

\- Shift-based substitution cipher

\- Replaces each letter with another letter at a fixed distance

\- Simple but historically important



\### 2. Vigenère Cipher

\- Key-based polyalphabetic cipher

\- More secure than Caesar cipher

\- Uses a repeating keyword for encryption

\## ▶️ How to Run the Project



Navigate to the `ciphers` directory and run:



```bash

python main.py

You will be presented with a menu to choose:



Encryption



Decryption



Cipher type



🎯 Learning Objectives

Understand classical encryption techniques



Learn substitution and key-based cryptography



Practice modular Python programming



Understand how encryption and decryption work internally



⚠️ Disclaimer

These algorithms are implemented only for educational purposes.

They are not secure and should not be used in real-world applications.
